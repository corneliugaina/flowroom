This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project is based on a [Net Ninja React+Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxIDLw0M-m0&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ij8CfkAY2RAGb-tmkNwQHG) tutorial/course, followed step by step.

## Description

- Contexte : when reading the book [Flow : The Psychology of Optimal Experience by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow), i was inspired to craft an app to document and monitoring my learning journey of web developpement. Also, by working on it, I can learn the clogs and tricks of React, a broad knowledge of Javascript ES6, Design System & web technologies. This project has mainly a learning purpose.  

- Objectif: a Dashboard to document my progress in web development, every skill, tutorial, course, projects will appear here. Features will be implemented au fur et Ã  mesure.  

- Mockup: coming soon. 

### Features 

- A To-Do list (WIP) : 
- GitHub user contribution activity API, for myself (to implement) at first, then for those users who will sign in with their GitHub.

Interleaving, time-blocking, deep work, splitting tasks (in small chunks), habits.
